This is the source code for a demo showing a method of rendering grass in three.js

I used it in my interactive experience ["to the Limbs"](https://create.viverse.com/TkZWCbJ)



Thankyou for inspiration. This is information for "A Number From the Ghost"

how I did stuff
Built with threejs. Running on Vite. Much knowledge was imparted by threejs journey. I used Blender for 3D modeling. The music was made with Ableton Live. I played all the instruments and did all the things. I used Tone.js to sync everything up in the game.

Follow me on Twitter and Instagram where I go into more detail about the process.

Also check out my writings at Medium for more insight.
